 ## Circular Trajectory	
 The circular trajectory generator will generate a circular trajectory such that it will  
 1. ramp up to a constant speed
 2. run several cycles of circles ( depending on the period and duration)
 3. ramp down to zero speed. 
Here are the parameters to set for generating the circular trajectory:
|Name|Chosen Files|
|---|---|
|`Radius`|`The radius of the circular trajectory`|
|`Period`|`The period time of finishing one circle`|
|`Duration`|`The total time of the circular trajectory`|

## Minimum Derivative Trajectory
The minimum_derivative trajectory generator will generate a trajectory that goes through a given path: 
|Name|Chosen Files|
|---|---|
|`Optimization Option`|`Trajectory optimization options`|
|`Payload Path`|`The path that payload needs to go through`|
